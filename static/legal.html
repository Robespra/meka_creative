If you wish to use these Paid Tools, or use any of Logojoy’s End Products outside of the Site, whether for commercial or personal use, you are required to pay all applicable and respective Fees in advance. If you purchase any Services or End Products that we offer for a Fee, you agree to Logojoy or our third party service providers, storing and updating your payment card information. You expressly agree (i) that we are authorized to charge you (A) the stated Fee, (B) any other Fees for Services you may purchase, and any applicable taxes in connection with your use of the Services to the payment card you provide and (ii) to reimburse us for all collection costs and interest for any overdue amounts.

b. Fee Changes – You understand that additional services or End Products that may be introduced in the future may be subject to additional fees. You further acknowledge and approve that Logojoy reserves the right to change its Fees at any time, at its sole discretion, upon notice to you if such changes affect your existing subscription. If you received a discount for a subscription fee, or any other promotional offer for a subscription fee, Logojoy shall have the right to renew your subscription automatically and without further notice at the full applicable Fee.

c. One Time Fee & Refunds – One time End Product fees are non-refundable. If a User has reason to believe that they were charged in error, they may provide a written notice to our Customer Support and request to cancel their Fee. When eligible, Fee cancellation can be performed by Customer Support only up to a period of 7 days from the Fee payment date, and only if the End Products associated with the Fee have not been downloaded or used outside of the Site, whether for commercial or personal use (“One Time Fee Refund Period”). We will not cancel Fees after that time or after an End Product has been downloaded or used outside of the Logojoy Site. Eligibility to cancel a Fee will be assessed by our Customer Support team based on a number of factors, including, without limitation, violations to our Terms of Service and improper usage of the Logojoy platform.

d. Subscription Fee & Refunds – If you are dissatisfied with any Logojoy Service subject to a Subscription Fees, whether monthly or annual, you may cancel your subscription and provide our Support team with a written request for a refund within Seven (7) days of having paid the initial Fee (“Subscription Refund Period”) as long as no design files created using the Service have been downloaded or used outside the platform. If you are a customer residing in a jurisdiction that requires a different Refund Period, we will be happy to accommodate these requirements in accordance with applicable laws. If Logojoy’s customer support team receives the refund notice during the Subscription Refund Period, you will be refunded with the amount you paid for the Service and Logojoy will cancel these Services accordingly. After the Subscription Refund Period, the Fees paid by you are non-refundable and non-cancellable. In addition, if we find that any End Products associated with the Fee have been downloaded or used outside of the Site, whether for commercial or personal use, and/or that the notice of cancellation has been given in bad faith or in an illegitimate attempt to avoid payment for services actually received and used, we reserve our right to charge the User who provided such notice for any Logojoy Services actually received, as permitted by law.

e. Taxes and Currencies – All Fees on the Logojoy Platform shall be in U.S. Dollars, except when and as specifically stated otherwise in writing by Logojoy.

In the event that Logojoy fails to collect the Fees owed by the User, we may in our sole and absolute discretion (but shall not be obligated to) try to collect at a later time, or block or cancel your User Account, with no further notice. Without derogating any of the foregoing. You shall be solely responsible to ensure a successful renewal of the Logojoy Services you use. Accordingly, the User shall hold the sole responsibility for any discontinuation of any Logojoy Services previously purchased by them, including due to a cancellation and/or failure to collect the applicable Fees, or due to any Logojoy Services not being under our automatic subscription renewals feature. The User acknowledges and agrees that they shall not have any claims or demands against Logojoy with relation to a discontinuation of any Logojoy Services or Third Party Services associated with Logojoy, for whatever reason.

g. Chargebacks – If the User rejects the charge of the payable Fees (“Chargeback”), the action shall be considered a breach of the User fee payment obligations, and their use of the Logojoy Services may be automatically suspended and/or terminated. In such case, Logojoy reserves the right to block the User Account without any option to repurchase or re-use it, and any end files and/or data contained in such User Account, including any unfinalized or finalized Designs.

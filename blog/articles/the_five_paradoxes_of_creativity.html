          <h1>The five paradoxes of creativity <small>3/10/2017</small></h1>
          <img class="thumbnail" src="http://placehold.it/850x350">
          <p>Understanding creativity means follow the different paradoxes that compose it. </p>
          <h3>First paradox: Order and disorder </h3>
<p>Barron defined the artistic sensitivity as a preference for order, elegant forms and harmony. All these terms are at the center of a passionate debate (what defines a form as elegant?), but in the context of this article we will be interested not just on the concept of order, since that is an interesting paradox of the creator. By order, in the creative field, we will understand the capacity of organizing our own disorder.  </p>
<p>Disorder entails a great deal of different information. The more expanded is the experience, the curiosity and the culture of the author, the richest and more variated will be his disorder. The objective they pursue is to organize that disorder for afterwards use it to make unexpected combinations (Paul Valery) with the elements they have (see the part on incubation and connections). Certain creators, unable of giving order to their internal disorder see their artistic capacities diminished when they have to deal with “unexpected combinations” and lose all clearness.  That provides us with the capacity of self-restraint so typical among creative people. Restraint regarding our own order, and restraint regarding our own work. </p>

<h3>Second Paradox: Implication and restraint</h3>
<quote>-Help me then, stammered him, we can’t leave her like this. Emotion had gained Claude and his eyes were also wet, in his condition of artist. He hurried, but the sculptor, who had just asked for his help, wanted to be alone to gather the leftovers, as if he feared the brutality that someone else could infringe on it. He slowly started to pick all the pieces up, moving over the floor on his knees. He took every piece and put them on a table. Soon he had formed the entire figure again, similar to that people who kill them self out of love, and who crash from the top of a monument and whose remains are collected, comic and pitiful, to be taken to the morgue. He, who had fallen again in front of her, was unable to stop looking at it, absent in a sadden contemplation. </quote>

<p>The collapse of Mahoudeau’s dreams, extract of The Work, by Emile Zola</p>

<p>Bruner gave value to the passion liking the object to the artist as the piece of work takes form. The individual is at the beginning the possessor of the object while he is conceiving it, then he became possessed by his own creation. In order to understand a creative attitude and continue with his work, he is obliged to take distance, in order to verify if the ongoing work corresponds with his initial attempts. That implication/restraint and Possessor/Possessed play is going to last during all the process. </p>

<h3>Third Paradox: Complexity and simplification </h3>
<p>A creative person finds a paradoxical joy in complexity and simplification. In complexity because he loves to set out problems and solve them. His joy in analysis will attract him towards complexity. Simplification is necessary to be able to organize and categorize the elements that compose his resources. A graphic creator will make a selection between essential and accessory. And generally, he will make an effort in getting rid of those things that complicate perception.  </p>
<h3>Forth Paradox: Divergent and convergent thinking. </p>
Guildford (1967) considered these models as the most important aspects of creativity. What do they consist on?
<h4>Divergent thinking </h4>
<p>Divergent thinking can be defined as the way of thinking that will allow individuals to create as much information as possible from relatively fragile constraints. An example: Guilford (1967) offered a pencil and a piece of paper to individuals and asked them to imagine a big number of possibilities to use that pencil. The results were counted depending on the number of imagined uses (fluency), number of categories (flexibility), the originality degree and the answer compared to the one given by the groups (originality) and the details precision (elaboration). 
The divergent thinking has therefore a tendency to stretch frontiers and expand the area of possibilities. </p>
<h4>Convergent thinking </h4>
<p>Convergent thinking can be defined as more constraining since it has to do with the fact of finding common points to all the elements and try to unify them in one single concept. In his experiments, Mednick (1962) proposed three concepts: hair, stretch and time. Individuals had to identify the concept which would allow to unify the three proposed elements. The answer was “length”. </p>
<p>Hudson affirms that people gifted with free association (divergent associations) will be attracted by arts, while people more gifted in convergent associations will be attracted by science and technology (Oxford, 1998). 
This affirmation can be contrasted, since the two first phases of the creative process are “divergent”, the last two are “convergent”. </p>
<h4>Fifth Paradox: Solitude, collaboration and social context </h4>
<p>If belonging to a creative community helps the creative impulse (the quest for a status, competition); solitude can be a good element for the individual to be focused and make his ideas reality. </p>

          <h1>Do drugs stimulate creativity ? <small>3/10/2017</small></h1>
          <img class="thumbnail" src="../../images/blog_drugs.svg">
          <p>Art has always been closely related to the use of drugs. Let’s imagine the creative “raw material” flowing during the creative process as something noisy and without control as if it were a tzigane orchestra in one of Kusturica’s movies. That orchestra (disguised as historical characters playing music with seafood and Pisa towers) is on the way leading to a small village. At the entrance of the village, a couple of policemen stop them and ask them to lower the noise, to get rid of their costumes and to stop playing music with seafood and Pisa towers. Does all of this make any sense? This is what happens when the material coming from the subconscious level goes through censorship before entering conscience. The “I” side of the personality rebuilds the distorted and ludic content with the help of control, order, logic and reason. 
 </p>
<p>Communication with the exterior world has a central importance for the development of the creative individual in general, and for the creative process in particular. Many creative people feel sometimes that their intellect dominates them; this prevents them from taking advantage of their interior freedom. Certain specialists such as Jung (1938) have elaborated conscience disconnection techniques so the subconscious knowledge can flourish. Picasso created a similar system, which allowed him to “let his ideas flow”. 
 </p>

 <h3>Another Girl, Another Planet</h3>

<p>
In order to make the “me - censor” lower the guard and have access to the material coming from the deepest of our minds, during recent history many artists have interwined their creativity with the consumption of psychoactives (absinthe, opium, cannabis, LSD…). In fact, studying creative process makes us understand why it can be very tempting to know that we have a direct access to an abundant and diversified material coming from the subconscious. Do these substances really stimulate creativity? Which are the mechanisms unlashing them?

</p>

<p>Certain substances such as psilocybin allow to make sleepy the second censor level and to feel pure creativeness. Barron (1964) tried that on several patients who thanked being able to separate from their “me” for a few minutes. The researches of Timothy Leary on LSD prove the same constant. LSD, mescaline, psilocybin, make possible a short but intense change in conscience and allow transcending the “inner I”. 

</p>

<p>These substances multiply the perception of information coming from the outside through their impact on the latent inhibition. Psychic perturbations provoked by these substances are close to schizophrenia since they act on the dopamine receptors. There is a risk for the people who can’t cope with the enormous flow of information received when dangerously approaching the state of psychosis. It is necessary to be trained on this matter, in order to be ready to smartly taking advantage of it, since the first effects without taking distance can be terrifying. Remember that imagination is not a dream, but a conscious recombination including sometimes images coming from dreams. 
 </p>

<p>Regarding heroin, a research carried out by Nat Hentoff in 1957, showed that 50% of Jazz music players in New York had already tried heroin, a 16% of them consumed it regularly. Another research carried out by Tolson and Cuyjet affirms that these music players consumed heroin to be able to take advantage of their creativity, of better feeling when they were on stage and mainly to bear the pressure of a society which disapproved their music at that time.  
 </p>


 <h3>Neurobiological explanation</h3>
 <p>
 These substances won’t be useful in the execution of the artwork. They will only allow the emergence of ideas coming from the subconscious, so the artist can use them when looking for inspiration for his work. The effect is not automatic and it depends on each person. Psychostimulators (amphetamines, cocaine, Deprenyl and ecstasy in a lower level) maintain a high level of dopamine and make neurons more excitable.    </p>


<p>Dopamine plays a principal role in creativity. This neurotransmitter (a chemical substance which allows the signal transmission from the cells to the brain by linking receptors) is involved in the control of emotions, pleasure, curiosity and movements as well as on the command of the information flux. Dopamine is seldom known as the “reward hormone” due to its intervention in the unconscious recognition of what could lead us to a reward. Dopamine is segregated to incite us to repeat an experience which was classified as rich in rewarding by our body.   </p>


<p>Recent researches have shown that the pleasure for the discovering, exploration and intrepidness, the awakening of the desire for new experiences (physiologic but also spiritual) as well as the impulse towards the quest for new information are also linked to dopamine.  
</p>

 <p>Serotonin provides the mental force needed to avoid being submerged by schizophrenic thinking. It is clear that the substances boosting the activity of dopamine and serotonin will have an impact on one's creativy. However, a repeated use of these substances could cause a reduction in the sensitivity of dopamine receptors. Tolerance to the doses increases, and as a result, it will be needed to increase the dose every time to obtain the same effects. 

 </p>

 <p>Cannabis will also intervene on the dopamine level, but it will also reduce the blood flux of the brain (a sensation of slowness, difficulty to memorize or to remember things).Almost the same as LSD, but on a less intense way, it will allow conscience to be closer to the feelings and external perceptions. Certain music players recognize to have a clearer perception after having consumed cannabis…

 </p>

 <h3>Sleep</h3>

 <p>Sleep or the moments just after waking up can also make emerge thoughts that normally wouldn’t pass the frontier of the censorship while we are in a normal brain activity. During the phase of falling asleep, mind suggestions are more or less controlled. But not for long... As we fall asleep, our dreams could potentially provide truly interesting material. But to use it we would need to make sure that we remember them.
 </p>

  <h3>Alcohol...</h3>

 <p>According to a recent research, alcohol (2 glasses of wine, no more) would restrain the rational thinking, loosen up the pressure on the work memory (the one alerting us about our surrounding) as well as allow our brain to realize deepest connections.
 </p>


 <p>A neurological explanation could also explain the result of that research. It is still a mysterious process for science, but the current assumption is that alcohol reduces the activity of the enzyme that destroys dopamine. This happens, obviously, with small doses of alcohol…
 </p>

 <h3>Or coffee?</h3>

 <p>Coffee won’t help us to go push beyond the limits of our creative resources, as some beers will. Coffee is an executional drug, many researches agree on the fact that coffee allows to increase the performance of the concentration quality if the activity doesn’t require a huge amount of abstract thinking. 
 In conclusion: drink coffee only after having had an original idea.
